# Bitwise-Logical-Unit-BLU-
Implementation of Bitwise Logical Unit  on ZedBoard (Zynq-7000)

Imagine controlling data bit by bit — turning individual binary digits into powerful decisions. That’s what a Bitwise Logical Unit does. It’s the unsung hero in processors, embedded systems, and cryptographic engines — flipping, masking, shifting, and comparing bits in real time.

In this project, I developed a 4-bit Bitwise Logical Unit using Verilog, capable of executing essential bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifting. I simulated the logic thoroughly using Vivado and deployed it on a ZedBoard, where switch inputs control the operation and LEDs display real-time output.
